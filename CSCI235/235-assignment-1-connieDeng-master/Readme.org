* Assignment 1

** Do not edit these files:
- .travis.yml
- Makefile
- 
** Do not add any files to the repo
You can add them locally but don't git add or push them.

** Make changes in:
- funcs.cpp, funcs.h to complete the assignment
- Readme.org - add the specified info at the top


** Instructions
- Go to ~http://travisci.com~ and log in / connect to Github. If that
  gives you a problem try travisci.org. By doing this, Travis should
  run the tests on your assignment every time you push. You can check
  out the status by looking at the Travis web site. It should also
  send you an email with the results of the tests on each build. It's
  faster to run the tests locally but this is a sanity check to make
  sure what you pushed works. It's also what I will use on your
  submissions.



- Add a function ~int sum(int n)~ to funcs.cpp/funcs.h. This function
  should calculate the sum of all the integers between 0 and n inclusive.

- Add a function ~int fact(int n);~ to funcs.cpp/funcs.h. This
  function should calculate and return the factorial of the parameter
  n.

- When you run:
  - ~make test~
  - ~./test/~

All tests should pass

- make sure to commit and push the repo back to GitHub

* Important notes
** Due Date
- This assignment is due on Wednesday morning 2/2 at 8:00am. 
** Testing
Note that this assignment uses doctest instead of catch. It's mostly
the same but much faster. You can find more information on doctest
here: https://github.com/onqtam/doctest
** GitHub classroom
I'm assigning this to test out GitHub classroom so as to see if it
makes sense for the class
